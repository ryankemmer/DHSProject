      <h1 class= "py-4">Introduction</h1>
      <p>Welcome to our study on <strong>Shape and Object Detection in Images.</strong> This study should take between 20 - 30 minutes to complete.</p>
      <p>This study will involve completing 36 different exercises related to object detection. For each question,
      you will be asked to determine if you believe one of a set of specified objects is or isn't in an image.
      From the results of this study, we want to better understand how independent visual screening judgments from multiple
      participants can be aggregated to perform challenging shape and object detection tasks.
      <h1 class= "py-2">Task</h1>
      You will be assigned 36 exercises where you will be prompted to look for one out of a set of specified objects
      in an image. For each exercise, you will be asked to respond to the following questions:
      <br>
      <br>
      <ol>
        <li>(a) Is the object in the image? If so, locate it in the image</li>
        <li>(b) What is your level of confidence in this decision?</li>
        <li>(c) How difficult did you find the image?</li>
      </ol>
      You will have 60 seconds to respond to these questions for each exercise. In addition, you will have the ability to rotate images to look at them at different angles. If you are unable to
      unable to answer these questions within the 60 second time frame, the image will disappear, and you will have to submit your answers.
      </p>
      <p>
      Please answer all questions to the best of your ability. If for whatever reason you do not answer all of the questions in an exercise,
      you will be prompted to try again with the remaining time that you have left. Some questions are purposely challenging, and it may be difficult to answer the questions accurately. If you are unsure about
      a certain question, we ask that you please answer it to the best of your ability.
