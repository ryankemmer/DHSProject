      <h1 class= "py-4">Introduction</h1>
      <p>Welcome to our study on <strong>Shape and Object Detection in Images.</strong> This study should take between 5 - 15 minutes to complete.</p>
      <p>This study will ask 14 different exercises related to object detection. For each question, 
      you will be asked to determine if you believe a specified object is or isn't in an image. 
      From this study, we want to better understand how independent visual screening judgments from multiple 
      participants can be aggregated to perform challenging shape and object detection tasks. 
      <h1 class= "py-2">Task</h1>
      You will be assigned 14 exercises where you will be prompted to look for a specified object 
      in an image. For each exercise, you will be asked to respond to the 3 following questions:
      <br>
      <br>
      <ol>
        <li>Is the object in the image?</li>
        <li>What is your level of confidence in this decision?</li>
        <li>What do you think the majority of people responded?</li>
      </ol>
      You will have 60 seconds to respond to these three questions for each exercise. If you are unable to
      unable to answer these questions within the 60 second time frame, the image will disappear, and you will have to submit your answers. 
      </p>
      <p>
      Please answer all 3 questions to the best of your ability. If for whatever reason you do not answer all of the questions for a task, 
      you will be prompted to try again with the remaining time that you have left. 
    
      </p>
      <p> <span class="text-danger">NOTE:</span> Your compensation will not be affected by your performance. 
      Some questions are purposely challenging, and it may be difficult to answer the questions accurately. If you are unsure about 
      a certain question, we ask that you please answer it to the best of your ability.
